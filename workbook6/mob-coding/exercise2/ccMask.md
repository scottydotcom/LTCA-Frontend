```js
function maskify(cc) {
  let maskedCC = "";
  const digitNumbers = cc.length;
  for (let i = 0; i < digitNumbers; i++) {
    if (i < digitNumbers - 4) {
      maskedCC += "#";
    } else {
      maskedCC += cc[i];
    }
  }
  return maskedCC;
}
```

**Initialize**

```js
let maskedCC = "";
```

The function initializes an empty string maskedCC that will be used to build the masked credit card number.

**Get length**

```js
const digitNumbers = cc.length;
```

The function gets the length of the input string cc (the credit card number) and stores it in a constant digitNumbers. This is done to avoid recalculating the length of the string in the loop.

**Iterate**

```js
for (let i = 0; i < digitNumbers; i++) {... }
```

The function uses a `for loop` to iterate over each character in the input string `cc`. The loop will run `digitNumbers` times.

**Check length string**
```js
if (i < digitNumbers - 4) {... } else {... }
```

Inside the loop, the function checks if the current index `i` is less than the length of the string minus 4. This is the key logic for masking the credit card number.

- If `i` is less than `digitNumbers - 4`, it means we're dealing with characters that should be masked. In this case, the function appends a `#` character to the `maskedCC` string using `maskedCC += "#";`.
- If `i` is greater than or equal to `digitNumbers - 4`, it means we're dealing with the last 4 characters of the credit card number, which should not be masked. In this case, the function appends the original character from the input string `cc` to the `maskedCC` string using `maskedCC += cc[i];`.
- return maskedCC;

After the loop completes, the function returns the fully masked credit card number as a string.
